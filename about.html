     <h3 class="text-secondary">Bio</h3>
     <p>Im not your typical Web Developer. I like to enjoy the goofy interesting, fun, side of life but know when its time to be serious. More often then not you can catch me at a live comedy show or a local band. When im not out and about I like to keep up on the latest web dev trends. Most recently I have been working on a video streaming/ chat hangout app that utilizes the MERN stack, I love javascript, but have experience in other Stacks: LAMP, WAMP, MERN, MEAN. Wether you just need a simple landing page or a full scale production web app I've got you covered.</p>
